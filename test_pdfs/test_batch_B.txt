GRIEVANCE COLLECTION - BATCH B
Municipal Corporation Ward 15
Date: December 2024
---

GRIEVANCE B1:
The streetlights on Main Road between sectors 5 and 7 are not working for the last 3 weeks. This is creating an unsafe environment for people walking and driving at night. We have complained many times but nothing has been done.

GRIEVANCE B2:
The public park in Rajiv Gandhi Nagar has become a dumping ground for construction debris. Children cannot play there anymore. The swings and slides are broken and never repaired.

GRIEVANCE B3:
Water supply in Model Town is available only for 2 hours in the morning. This is not sufficient for a family of 5 members. We request 24x7 water supply or at least 6 hours daily.

GRIEVANCE B4:
The road near government hospital is full of potholes and is in very bad condition. Patients face difficulty reaching the hospital. Many accidents have happened on this road.

GRIEVANCE B5:
Electricity bills in our area show unusually high readings. When we checked, the meters were found to be faulty but no one is replacing them despite multiple requests.
