GRIEVANCE 1:
The streetlights on the main road of Sector 15 near the market area have been non-functional for the past 2 weeks. This is causing major safety concerns for pedestrians and vehicles during nighttime. Multiple complaints have been filed but no action taken yet.

GRIEVANCE 2:
There is severe water logging issue near the community park in Sector 15. During rainy season, the entire area gets flooded making it impossible for residents to access the park. The drainage system needs immediate repair.

GRIEVANCE 3:
Garbage collection in Sector 15 Block C has become extremely irregular. The garbage truck comes only once a week instead of daily. This is causing foul smell and attracting stray dogs.

GRIEVANCE 4:
The road connecting Sector 15 market to the bus stand has developed multiple potholes. Several accidents have occurred due to these potholes. We request immediate road repair.

GRIEVANCE 5:
Open sewage drain near Sector 15 Government School is overflowing. Students have to cross this area daily which poses serious health risks. Urgent action required.
