Municipal Corporation Ward 12
Date: December 2024
---

GRIEVANCE A1:
The streetlights on MG Road between sectors 5 and 7 have not been functioning for the past 3 weeks. This creates a dangerous situation for pedestrians and vehicles during night time. Multiple complaints have been raised but no action has been taken yet.

GRIEVANCE A2:
There is a severe water logging issue near Gandhi Chowk. During monsoon season, the entire area gets flooded making it impossible for residents to commute. The drainage system appears to be completely blocked and needs immediate attention.

GRIEVANCE A3:
The garbage collection in Nehru Nagar has become extremely irregular. Sometimes the garbage truck doesn't come for 4-5 days causing foul smell and health hazards in the locality. Stray animals are spreading the garbage everywhere.

GRIEVANCE A4:
The road connecting to the government hospital has developed multiple potholes. This is causing major inconvenience to patients and ambulances. Several accidents have already occurred due to these potholes.

GRIEVANCE A5:
There is no proper sewage system in Green Park Colony. All the sewage water flows openly on the streets creating unhygienic conditions and mosquito breeding grounds.
